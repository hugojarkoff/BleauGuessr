# BleauGuessr project 

Id Fontainebleau boulders by photo

Little side project I have. Will probably take some time, but the long term main goal is to be able to identify any boulder in Fontainebleau forest by taking a picture and processing it with some identification model.

Few ideas : 
- Remove traces lines on bleau.info photos (simple model should to it) => More photos to train/test
- Id photos with Humans to remove them from train/test
